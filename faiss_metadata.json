This required fundamental change of several of our services and their dependencies. The timeline was risky and some of the risks ended up being realized. Since we had a hard deadline for peak season, I made the call to ship the core product while working through some of the admin and self-serve tools in parallel.

A very noble effort that I supported and encouraged for a long time. The engineer made great strides in that space that we would never have achieved without fostering that passion. Sadly the company underwent a reduction in force and we had to merge that team with a team that leads customer integrations. While it was important for us to continue to make progress in the orders space, it was more important for the team to focus on OE improvements and to collectively work on pressing integrations projects. The engineer was unhappy but understanding since the overall team priorities were shifting. With 1:1s and meeting the engineer where they were, I and their manager channeled the orders space passion into operational excellence and swarming on projects that were right for the team with great results.

I've spent years building teams and platforms that scale. At Flexe, I lead a 15-person team that owns the entire customer-facing stack: from warehouse operations to orders to billing to mobile apps, running both in the web UI and on 2400+ Android devices at our warehouses. At Amazon Alexa, I launched Communications features (Calling, Messaging, Announcements) across multiple devices and modalities. Amazon taught me services at scale and Flexe taught me how to scale teams up and down, and how to inspire and lead with conviction and humility. This role in Product Foundations resonates with me because platform work is where I thrive. Building shared capabilities that accelerate product teams, driving adoption through usefulness rather than mandates, representing platform needs to leadership: this is the work I find most meaningful. I've done it in warehouse tech and voice AI. Doing it for the products that power Claude feels like the natural next step. What draws me specifically to Anthropic is the mission-first approach to AI development. I've been spearheading LLM adoption at Flexe: using AI for crash identification, bug root-causing, localization, and building internal tools. I've seen firsthand how transformative, misunderstood, and misused this technology could be. Anthropic's commitment to building AI that's safe and beneficial resonates deeply, and my OpenClaw agent will thank me for making their own experience better!", "/root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-03.md", 7], [17186, "[2026 02 03] 2026-02-03: at Flexe: using AI for crash identification, bug root-causing, localization, and building internal tools.
